# Project Tracker

## Description
Created a project tracker website that allows users to create and track projects. Users can name their project, add a description, date of completion, and type of project. Users can also remove their project from their list if they wish to do so.

This project show cases my ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website that allows users to interact with it. I also used Bootstrap to style the website and JQuery to make the website more interactive. LocalStorage was used to store the projects that the user created.

## How to Run

2. fill out the form with the project name, description, date of completion, and type of project
3. click "add project" to add the project to your list
4. click "remove project" to remove a project from your list
